## About The Project

I have found jetpack compose implementation performance better or user friendly due to these reasons:

Here's why:

* I have write very less code to group the rows by stickyHeader in Compose, Very less Boilerplate Code
* LazyColumn is alternative of RecyclerView with same performance
* Declarative format is much user-friendly, attractive and easily maintainable due to kotlin Support
* I experienced this implementation performance wise very much same as in Xml
